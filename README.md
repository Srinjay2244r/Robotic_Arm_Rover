A small autonomous car will roam an urban area, using a front-mounted camera to continuously scan for garbage. When garbage is detected by a cloud based deep learning model, a robotic arm mounted on the chassis will execute a pick-and-drop maneuver to collect the item and deposit it into an attached trash container.
